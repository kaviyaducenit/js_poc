        <H2>BASIC HTML TAGS </H2>
<IMG SRC="../content/img/KtNLei35Vb6K3SN99binuW-650-80.png">
<H3>1)HTML</H3>
<H5><P>All web pages start with the html element. It’s also called the root element because it’s at the root of the tree of elements that make up a web page. To create the html element, you write an opening <html> tag followed by a closing </html> tag. Everything else in your web page then goes between these 2 tags
</P></H5>
<H3>2)HEAD</H3>
<H5><P>The head element contains information about the web page, as opposed to the web page content itself. There are many elements that you can put inside the head element, such as:
•	title (described below)
•	link, which you can use to add style sheets and favicons to your page
•	meta, for specifying things like character sets, page descriptions, and keywords for search engines
•	script, for adding JavaScript code to the page </P></H5>
<H3>3)TITLE</H3>
<H5><P>The title element contains the title of the page. The title is displayed in the browser’s title bar (the bar at the top of the browser window), as well as in bookmarks, search engine results, and many other places.
The title should describe the page’s content succinctly and accurately. Try to give each page of your site its own unique title.
 </P></H5>

<H3>4) BODY</H3>

<H5><P>Just starting out with HTML? Here are 10 essential HTML tags that you’ll need to know when building your web pages. If you learn how these 10 tags work then you’ll have enough knowledge to put together a basic page.
At the end of the tutorial you’ll find code for an example web page that includes all 10 tags, so that you can see how to use them.
Tags and elements
An HTML tag is a special word or letter surrounded by angle brackets, < and >. You use tags to create HTML elements, such as paragraphs or links.
Many elements have an opening tag and a closing tag — for example, a p (paragraph) element has a <p> tag, followed by the paragraph text, followed by a closing </p> tag.
Some elements don’t have a closing tag. These are called empty elements. For example, the br element for inserting line breaks is simply written <br>.
If you’re working with XHTML then you write empty elements using self-closing tags — for example, <br />.
Now let’s look at those 10 tags!</P></H5>

<H3>5) h1  —A SECTION HEADING</H3>
<H5><P>Headings let you break up your page content into readable chunks. They work much like headings and subheadings in a book or a report.
HTML actually supports 6 heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. h1 is for the most important headings, h2 is for less important subheadings, and so on. Typically you won’t need to use more than h1, h2 and h3, unless your page is very long and complex.
