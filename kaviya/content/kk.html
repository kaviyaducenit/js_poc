    <h3>1)HTML</h3>
    <p>
        All web pages start with the html element. It’s also called the root element because it’s at the root of the
        tree of elements that make up a web page. To create the html element, you write an opening <html> tag followed
        by a closing</html> tag. Everything else in your web page then goes between these 2 tags
    </p>
    <h3>2)HEAD</h3>
    <p>
        The head element contains information about the web page, as opposed to the web page content itself. There are
        many elements that you can put inside the head element, such as:
        • title (described below)
        • link, which you can use to add style sheets and favicons to your page
        • meta, for specifying things like character sets, page descriptions, and keywords for search engines
        • script, for adding JavaScript code to the page
    </p>
    <h3>3)TITLE</h3>
    <p>
        The title element contains the title of the page. The title is displayed in the browser’s title bar (the bar at
        the top of the browser window), as well as in bookmarks, search engine results, and many other places.
        The title should describe the page’s content succinctly and accurately. Try to give each page of your site its
        own unique title.
    </p>
    <h3>4) BODY</h3>
    <p>
        Just starting out with HTML? Here are 10 essential HTML tags that you’ll need to know when building your web
        pages. If you learn how these 10 tags work then you’ll have enough knowledge to put together a basic page.
        At the end of the tutorial you’ll find code for an example web page that includes all 10 tags, so that you can
        see how to use them.
        Tags and elements
        An HTML tag is a special word or letter surrounded by angle brackets, < and>. You use tags to create HTML
        elements, such as paragraphs or links.
        Many elements have an opening tag and a closing tag — for example, a p (paragraph) element has a <p> tag,
        followed by the paragraph text, followed by a closing </p> tag.
        Some elements don’t have a closing tag. These are called empty elements. For example, the br element for
        inserting line breaks is simply written <br>.
        If you’re working with XHTML then you write empty elements using self-closing tags — for example, <br />.
        Now let’s look at those 10 tags!
    </p>
    <h3>5) h1 —A SECTION HEADING</h3>
    <p> 
        Headings let you break up your page content into readable chunks. They work much like headings and subheadings
        in a book or a report.
        HTML actually supports 6 heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. h1 is for the most important headings, h2
        is for less important subheadings, and so on. Typically you won’t need to use more than h1, h2 and h3, unless
        your page is very long and complex.

        <p>
            The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the
            body tag.
            HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the
            document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.The head tag in HTML is used to
            define the head portion of the document which contains information related to the document. The head tag
            contains other head elements such as title, meta, link, style link etc. In HTML 4.01 the headelement was
            mandatory but in HTML5, the head element can be omitted
        </p>

    <b>
        <h2>Title</h2>
    </b>
    <span>
        <p>The title tag is required in all HTML documents and it defines the title of the document.The title
            element:defines a title in the browser toolbar provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
            displays a title for the page in search-engine results. The HTML title tag is used for declaring the title,
            or name, of the HTML document. The title is usually displayed in the browser's title bar (at the top). It is
            also displayed in browser bookmarks and search results. The title tag is placed between the opening and
            closing head> tags.
            Title attribute is an HTML attribute that can be added to any element, but it is most commonly used with
            links and images. It allows you to provide additional information about the link or the image. ... Typically
            web browsers display the title attribute on mouseover.

    <b>
        <h2>Body</h2>
    </b>
    <span>
        <p>
            When writing in HTML, the body> tag is used to contain a web page's content, including hyperlinks, images,
            tables, text, etc. It is required in every HTML document, and there may only be one body> tag per page. The
            head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html> tag and the
            body> tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. ... Metadata typically define the document title,
            character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

    <b>
        <h2> Script</h2>
    </b>
    <span>
        <p>
            The script tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript). The script element either contains
            scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute. Common uses for
            JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
